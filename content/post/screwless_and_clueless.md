# Goal

Through this project, they aimed to give participants a deeper, more intuitive understanding of timberâ€™s properties and the value of old-growth knowledge.
Included below is a description of the finished project and the process involved in its creation.

# Location

The original plan was to place the shelter along a hiking trail in the national park.
Given the lack of quality timber, cladding and roofing in particular, the decision was made to place the shelter in the Mitrovac park.
Here it would be possible for the rangers to treat the wood, once sufficiently dried, with a lot less hassle than out in the park proper.
A decent compromise given the frequency with which hikers and cyclists camp in the park.
