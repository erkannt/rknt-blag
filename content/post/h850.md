# Setting up my LG G5

## Downloads

- [Unofficial Lineage 15](https://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-g5/development/rom-unofficial-lineageos-15-1-g5-t3806842)
- [Magisk Root](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445)
- [NanoDroid, Patcher and Wizard](https://github.com/Nanolx/NanoDroid)
- [cstark27's GCam ports](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/google-camera-mods/cstark27-google-camera-mod-wide-angle-t3747263) for normal and wideangle camera

## Process

- unlock and install TWRP according to [Lineage Guide](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/h850/install)
  - use TWRP from X86CPU, regular one had issues with encryption
- enable *Developer Settings* and *ADB*
- format external SD Card and copy over installer zips (feels faster than using `adb sideload` for installs)
- `adb reboot recovery`
- format everything except SD card
- install from zip: - __Official__ Lineage 14
- boot into Lineage and encrypt phone
- upon encryption success:
- install from zip:
  - toX86CPU.zip as prep
  - unofficial LOS 15.1 (reboot after install to check)
  - unofficial LOS 16 (reboot after install to check)
  - Magisk.zip (make sure to later install the Magisk Manager apk)
  - NanoDroid Wizard (configure to your liking, I prefer installing apps myself)
  - NanoDroid Patcher (as Lineage hasn't got spoofing, this takes some time)
  - NanoDroid

## oandbackup notes

- didn't work, so used app-internal backup/restore
  - Signal
  - Whatsapp

- apk didn't work but data did:
  - AirBnB

- apk worked but data did not:
  - DB Navigator
 

## When things get buggered up

To remove encryption and wipe:
```
adb shell recovery --wipe_data --set_filesystem_encryption=off
```

When TWRP throws error on wipes: power off and boot to recovery.

To access recovery: hold down power and volume down, release power on LG logo and repress until recovery is reached.
